## Motivation
I have been using Free Code Camp to learn front end development and ive just recently completed the front end development libraries and responsive web design certification course . While using FCC ive realised how often I would open up new tabs to refer back to a previous lesson/project or a piece of documentation. In my case i would just let the amount of tabs build up in chrome making it hard to navigate. I thought itd be a good idea to create a chrome extension to fix this problem I had. It also meant I had a chance to implement what I've learned through FCC and have a project to show off in job interviews.

The extension uses chromes side panel to display a table of contents of FCC's curriculum. Users should be able to click the content elements to open the page in the current tab or in a new tab group. Theres also a search bar to search through the full curriculum.

## Usage
Download this extension from the [chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/contents-panel-for-fcc/cmogdnmmkblhlbdbppfahmclekapmdjo)

or

1. Download this repository as zip file and unzip it
2. Go to chrome://extensions/
3. Turn on developer mode (in the top right corner of the page)
4. Click load unpacked and use the unzipped folder
5. Click the sidepanel and you should find it in the drop down menu :D
