## Motivation
I have been using Free Code Camp to learn front end development and ive just recently completed the front end development libraries and responsive web design certification course . While using FCC ive realised how often I would open up new tabs to refer back to a previous lesson/project or a piece of documentation. In my case i would just let the amount of tabs build up in chrome making it hard to navigate. I thought itd be a good idea to create a chrome extension to fix this problem I had. It also meant I had a chance to implement what I've learned through FCC and have a project to show off in job interviews.

The extension uses chromes side panel to display a table of contents of FCC's curriculum. Users should be able to click the content elements to open the page in the current tab or in a new tab group. Theres also a search bar to search through the full curriculum.
